"Inheritance is the ability to define a new class(child class) that is a modified version of an existing class(parent class)"
syntax

class Parent_class_Name:
#Parent_class code block
class Child_class_Name(Parent_class_name):
#Child_class code block


Single inheritance exists when a class is only derived from a single base class. Or in other words when a child class is using the methods 
and properties of only a single parent class then single inheritance exists.

Advantages of inheritance:

    It promotes codeâ€™s reusability as we do not have to copy the same code again to our new class.
    It makes the program more efficient.
    We can add more features to our already built class without modifying it or changing its functionality.
    It provides a representation of real-world relationships.
