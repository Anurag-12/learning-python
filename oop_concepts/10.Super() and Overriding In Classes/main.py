How to override class methods in Python?

Overriding occurs when a derived class or child class has the same method that has already been defined in the base or parent class. 
Being the same methods with the same name and number of parameters, when called checks for the method first in a child class, and runs 
it ignoring the method in the parent class because it is already overridden. In the case of Instance variables, the case is a little
different. When the method is called, the program will look for any instance variable having the same name as the one that is called 
in the child, then in the parent, and after that, it comes again into child class if not found.

Where does super() fit in all this?

When we want to call an already overridden method, then the use of super function comes in. It is a built-in function, so no requirement 
of any module import statement. What super does is, it allows us to use of the method of our superclass, that in the case of inheritance 
is the parent class.

Syntax of using super() is

class Parent_Class(object):
      def __init__(self):
            pass

class Child_Class(Parent_Class):
     def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           
super() returns a temporary object of the superclass that then allows you to call that superclassâ€™s methods.
 The primary use case of super() is to extend the functionality of the inherited method.
